Hello!

This is a incredibly small & primitive mod, essentially all it does is it adds functionality that when you hit a sheep (baby or adult) it will die, having burst into flames of various sizes.

This mod primarily serves as a way for me to get my feet wet in the modding scene, but if for any reason you'd like to use it, modify it, or really anything else, feel free to go ahead and do so! I hope you find some enjoyment from it.

Thanks!
