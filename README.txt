Hello!

This is a incredibly small & primitive mod, essentially all it does is it adds functionality that when you hit a sheep (baby or adult) with a blaze rod it will instantly die, having exploded in an explosion of varying sizes.

This mod primarily serves as a way for me to get my feet wet in minecraft modding, but if for any reason you'd like to use it, modify it, or really do anything else with it, feel free to go ahead and do so! I hope you find some enjoyment from it.

Thanks!
